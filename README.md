# Food Delivery Cost Analysis Using Python

## Project Overview
This project, **Food Delivery Cost Analysis Using Python**, explores the costs, discounts, and profitability within a food delivery dataset. Using Python for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, the project provides insights into cost distribution, profit margins, and identifies areas for potential cost optimization.


## Project Details

### 1. Data Import and Exploration
- Imported CSV data from Google Drive using Google Colab.
- Inspected data structure, including columns, types, and sample rows.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- **Date Formatting:** Converted date columns for consistent date-time handling.
- **Discount Standardization:** Cleaned and standardized "Discounts and Offers" values.
- **Null Value Handling:** Filled missing values in key columns with 0 to avoid calculation errors.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- **Total Costs Calculation:** Combined relevant cost columns to create a "Costs" field.
- **Profit Calculation:** Computed "Profit" by subtracting total costs from commission fees.

### 4. Data Visualization and Analysis
- **Cost Distribution Visualization:** Displayed delivery fee, discounts, and processing fee proportions using a pie chart.
- **Profit and Cost Comparison:** Summarized "Commission Fee," "Costs," and "Profit" values using a bar chart.
- **Profit Distribution:** Visualized profit distribution across orders using a histogram.

## Key Insights
- Quantified costs and profits to reveal the proportionate impact of delivery fees, discounts, and processing fees.
- Insights highlight areas for potential profit increase through cost-saving initiatives.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Platform:** Google Colab (Github raw link for data access)
